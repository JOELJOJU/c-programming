Welcome to my C programming repository! This repository includes various C programs and projects.
Getting Started

To use the programs, you need a C compiler like GCC. Optionally, you can use Make for building.
Building Programs

Navigate to the program's directory and compile it using:

gcc -o program_name source_file.c

Replace program_name with the name you want for the executable and source_file.c with your C source file.
Running Programs

After compiling, you can run the program with:

./program_name

For example, if you have a file named hello.c, you would compile it with:

gcc -o hello hello.c

And run it with:

./hello
